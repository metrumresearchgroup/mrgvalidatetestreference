# mrgvalidate-test-reference
A frozen clone of rbabylon to use for testing [mrgvalidate](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgvalidate). The purpose of this is to have a static repo that we can "validate" and always get a predictable output.

Pulled the 0.6.0 tag, commit hash [9587b7e0c58d12012b2e1f2becb2d5b561a44514](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/rbabylon/commit/9587b7e0c58d12012b2e1f2becb2d5b561a44514), and thinned out a lot of the tests of speed reasons. Also deleted the docs, etc. because they're not needed for this purpose.
